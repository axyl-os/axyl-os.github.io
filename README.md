### We are Working on a Major Change in AxylOS

The migration of AxylOS from an X11 base to a Wayland base marks a significant evolution in the system's graphical interface framework. This transition represents a deliberate step towards modernizing the core infrastructure of AxylOS, aligning it with the latest advancements in display server technology. Wayland's inherent advantages, such as improved performance, enhanced security, and better support for modern hardware, promise to elevate the user experience to new heights. This migration effort involves meticulous planning, extensive testing, and seamless integration to ensure a smooth transition for users and developers alike. By embracing Wayland, AxylOS is poised to offer a more robust, efficient, and visually appealing computing environment, setting the stage for continued innovation and growth in the realm of operating systems.

### What is going to Replace the Xorg Window Managers we Currently have?

In our ongoing pursuit of a more streamlined and efficient user experience, we're embracing a minimalistic approach in AxylOS. Rather than relying on traditional window managers like BSPWM, we're opting for Wayland Compositors such as Hyprland and Wayfire. These compositors offer a lightweight yet powerful alternative, aligning perfectly with our vision of a sleek and responsive operating environment. By leveraging the capabilities of Wayland, coupled with the flexibility and innovation of Hyprland and Wayfire, we're poised to deliver a user experience that prioritizes simplicity, speed, and versatility. This shift not only enhances performance and resource utilization but also opens doors to a host of new possibilities for customization and user interaction. With this strategic decision, AxylOS continues its commitment to pushing the boundaries of modern computing while staying true to its minimalist ethos.
